# Crisis Management Bulk SMS Portal (Frontend)

This repository contains the **frontend** of a Crisis Management - Bulk SMS Portal I developed as a project trainee at Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC). Due to confidentiality reasons, I am unable to share the full project, including the backend and database components. Instead, this repository includes a copy of the frontend work I completed for BARC, located in this directory.

## Project Overview

In my role as a project trainee at BARC, I designed and developed a crisis management Bulk SMS portal for the institution and its neighboring areas. Leveraging **React**, **Django**, and an **Advanced REST Client**, I constructed a database, integrated it with REST APIs, incorporated an SMS Gateway, and crafted an intuitive user interface within a six-week timeframe.

### Key Features
- **Intuitive UI**: Built with React to ensure a seamless user experience for crisis communication.
- **API Integration**: Designed to interact with REST APIs for SMS Gateway functionality (backend not included here due to confidentiality).

**Note**: The backend (Django, database, SMS Gateway integration) and other sensitive components are not included in this repository due to confidentiality constraints imposed by BARC.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React (available in this repository)
- **Backend**: Django (not included due to confidentiality)
- **API Testing**: Advanced REST Client (used for development, not included)
- **Database**: Custom database (not included due to confidentiality)
- **SMS Gateway**: Integrated for bulk SMS functionality (not included due to confidentiality)

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
